A custom middleware for [graphql-ruby](https://github.com/rmosolgo/graphql-ruby)

## Goals

- Provide resolver-level caching for [GraphQL](https://graphql.org) APIs written in ruby
- Configurable to work with or without Rails
- [API Documentation](https://www.rubydoc.info/gems/graphql-cache)

## Why?

At [stackshare](https://stackshare.io) we've been rolling out [graphql-ruby](https://github.com/rmosolgo/graphql-ruby) for several of our new features and found ourselves in need of a caching solution.  We could have simply used `Rails.cache` in our resolvers, but this creates very verbose types or resolver classes.  It also means that each and every resolver must define it's own expiration and key.  GraphQL Cache solves that problem by integrating caching functionality into the [graphql-ruby](https://github.com/rmosolgo/graphql-ruby) resolution process making caching transparent on most fields except for a metadata flag denoting the field as cached.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'graphql-cache'
```

And then execute:

```sh
$ bundle
```

Or install it yourself as:

```sh
$ gem install graphql-cache
```

## Setup

1. Use GraphQL Cache as a plugin in your schema.

  ```ruby
  class MySchema < GraphQL::Schema
    query Types::Query

    use GraphQL::Cache
  end
  ```
2. Add the custom caching field class to your base object class. This adds the `cache` metadata key when defining fields.
  ```ruby
  module Types
    class Base < GraphQL::Schema::Object
      field_class GraphQL::Cache::Field
    end
  end
  ```

## Configuration

GraphQL Cache can be configured in an initializer:

```ruby
# config/initializers/graphql_cache.rb

GraphQL::Cache.configure do |config|
  config.namespace = 'GraphQL::Cache' # Cache key prefix for keys generated by graphql-cache
  config.cache     = Rails.cache      # The cache object to use for caching
  config.logger    = Rails.logger     # Logger to receive cache-related log messages
  config.expiry    = 5400             # 90 minutes (in seconds)
  config.force     = false            # Cache override, when true no caching takes place
end
```

## Usage

Any object, list, or connection field can be cached by simply adding `cache: true` to the field definition:

```ruby
field :calculated_field, Int, cache: true
```

By default all keys will have an expiration of `GraphQL::Cache.expiry` which defaults to 90 minutes.  If you want to set a field-specific expiration time pass a hash to the `cache` parameter like this:

```ruby
field :calculated_field, Int, cache: { expiry: 10800 } # expires key after 180 minutes
```

When passing a hash in the `cache` parameter the possible options are:

- `expiry`: expiration time for this field's key in seconds (default: 5400)
- `force`: for cache misses on this field (default: false)
- `prefix`: cache key prefix (appended after GraphQL::Cache.namespace)

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
